title: Curves with Trefoil Boundary
order: 1
permalink: trefoil-boundaries

* We are looking for two families of curves: <mark style="color:#0074D9">blue</mark> and <mark style="color:#FF851B">orange</mark>.

* We call where <mark style="color:#0074D9">blue</mark> and <mark style="color:#FF851B">orange</mark> curves coincide a *rung*.

* Any part of the curves that is not a rung is called a *fibration boundary*.

* We find our curves so that the fibration boundary is exactly the trefoil knot.
